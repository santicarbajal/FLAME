#    How many  types of clients  do we want to identify?
#    Note: 
#          Set this value to a high number, say 50.
#          Run the code : python  -OO test.py
#          See the results  of Elbow Method in  the file Inertial ElbowMethod.png, under the PNGSPATH folder
#          Decide the maximum number of Types, set MAXCLUSTERS to that value, and
#          Run the program again: python  -OO test.py
